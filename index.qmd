# About me  
:::{#hero-heading}
::: {.left-align}
I am an oceanographer using ocean observations with the aim of understanding how ocean dynamics shapes biogeochemistry and phytoplankton in the ocean. 

Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Physical Oceanography group at the University of Southampton, National Oceanography Centre, learning about mixing!

## Postdoctoral project
::: {.justify-text}
I am participating on the [C-Streams project](https://c-streams.uk/){target="_blank"}, under supervision of Prof. [Alberto Naveira Garabato](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5x2hkq/professor-alberto-naveira-garabato){target="_blank"} and following the advice of [Bieito Fernández Castro](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5ygpzq/doctor-bieito-fernandez-castro){target="_blank"} and [Louis Clément](https://noc.ac.uk/n/Louis+Clement){target="_blank"}, among others. C-Streams addresses the role of the North Atlantic in the global carbon cycle as a contribution to one of the World Climate Research Programme Grand Challenges “*Carbon Feedbacks in the Climate System*”. Our task within this project is to understand how mixing processes modify the nutrients and carbon carried by the Gulf Stream as it enters the North Atlantic.

## PhD thesis
::: {.justify-text}
Prior to this position, I completed [my PhD](http://hdl.handle.net/11093/7204) in Oceanography at the University of Vigo, Spain. My PhD topic was related to [thin layers of phytoplankton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQEJA2p6gzE) in a highly dynamic coastal upwelling system (Galician Rías, Iberian Peninsula), their characteristics, mechanisms of formation and ecological relevance. I also investigated how [turbulence and stratification](https://youtu.be/2jNNQYyyVgk) patterns are related to the [extraordinary productivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8DHxbhwPpI) in that region and their relationship with harmful algal blooms.

During this period, I participated in a few cruises collecting microstructure measurements, which sparked my interest in observing the ocean.
