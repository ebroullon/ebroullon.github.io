    "text": "I am an oceanographer using ocean observations with the aim of understanding how ocean dynamics shape biogeochemistry and phytoplankton in the ocean.\nCurrently, I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Physical Oceanography group at the University of Southampton, National Oceanography Centre, learning about mixing. Below, you can read more about my research.\n\n\n\n\n\nOcean mixing\nPhysical-biological interactions\nObservational oceanography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am participating on the C-Streams project, under supervision of Prof. Alberto Naveira Garabato and following the advice of Bieito Fernández Castro and Louis Clément, among others. C-Streams addresses the role of the North Atlantic in the global carbon cycle as a contribution to one of the World Climate Research Programme Grand Challenges “Carbon Feedbacks in the Climate System”. Our task within this project is to understand how mixing processes modify the nutrients and carbon carried by the Gulf Stream as it enters the North Atlantic.\nDuring the first year of my postdoctoral stage, we developed a tool to estimate isopycnal stirring and diapycnal mixing from finescale CTD data. The methodology was validated by comparing mixing estimates from Argo float finescale data and direct mixing microstructure observations in the eastern side of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. This approach allowed us to get, at least, a decade of mixing timeseries.\nIn relation to my postdoctoral research, I took part in the CarTRidge oceanographic cruise (2025) on board the RSS James Cook. CarTRidge was a multidisciplinary expedition aiming to test the hypothesis that the mid-Atlantic Ridge serves as a hotspot for carbon export to the deep ocean. To test that idea, we sailed from Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) to Walvis Bay (Namibia) for ~40 days, deploying a lot of instruments and taking hundreds of water samples. In the physics team, we measured turbulence deploying different VMP depending on the target depth (VMP2000 and VMP6000), as well as a novel equipment, the FloatRider. The project explored how tidal flows over the ridge generate enhanced turbulence, driving nutrients into the euphotic zone and boosting phytoplankton activity. This field experience gave me the opportunity to deepen my understanding of mixing processes and their connection to ocean productivity and the carbon cycle.\n\n\n\nFrom top left to down right: VMP6000 at deck, FloatRider after recovery, VMP2000 at back deck, VMP6000 being deployed, CarTRidge Team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to this position, I completed my PhD in Oceanography at the University of Vigo, Spain. My PhD topic was related to thin layers of phytoplankton in a highly dynamic coastal upwelling system (Galician Rías, Iberian Peninsula), their characteristics, mechanisms of formation and ecological relevance. I also investigated how turbulence and stratification patterns are related to the extraordinary productivity in that region and their relationship with harmful algal blooms. You can check the presentation here.\nDuring this period, I participated in a few cruises (REMEDIOS-TLP, ECOSUMA) collecting microstructure measurements, which sparked my interest in observing the ocean.\n\n\n\nSchematic of the thin layers of phytoplankton dynamics in an upwelling bay. From Chapter 4. Available at http://hdl.handle.net/11093/7204\n\n\nAdditionally, throughout my thesis, I have visited different research centres, such as Scripps Institution of Oceanography (host: Peter JS Franks), the University of Liverpool (host: Jonathan Sharples) or NOC Southampton. Some of the contributions to my publications have come out of these insightful visits!"
